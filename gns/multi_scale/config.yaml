# Multi-Scale GNN Configuration
# This single config file is used for all modes (train/valid/rollout)
# to ensure consistency between training and inference

# Mode & Paths
# mode: 'train', 'valid', or 'rollout'
# - train: Train a new model (set model_file to null or to resume from checkpoint)
# - valid: Validate trained model on validation set (requires model_file)
# - rollout: Generate predictions on test set (requires model_file)
mode: train
data_path: "./datasets/taylor_impact_2d/data_processed/"
model_path: "./models/"
output_path: "./rollouts/"

# Model Loading (required for 'valid' and 'rollout' modes)
# For rollout/validation: set to trained model filename (e.g., 'model-final-000010.pt' or 'model-best-001000.pt')
# For training: set to null (trains from scratch) or specify to resume training
model_file: null  # Example: "model-final-000010.pt" for rollout mode
train_state_file: "train_state.pt"

# Inference
inference_mode: autoregressive
debug_graph: false
